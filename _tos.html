                                <p>You agree that the services provided on PerfectFX Option Trade  do not constitute an offer of securities or solicitation for investments in securities in any jurisdiction. None of the information provided should be considered an invitation or inducement to engage in any sort of investment activity. You agree and acknowledge that the tokens listed in PerfectFX Option Trade  do not constitute shares or equities or securities or financial instruments or investments in any form in any jurisdiction. In addition, you acknowledge the following:</p>

                                <p>Crypto asset transactions made by you from your PerfectFX Option Trade  wallet are irreversible. If you send crypto assets to an incorrect address or send the wrong amount, you cannot retrieve it. PerfectFX Option Trade  will not be liable for executing a transaction if the instruction relates to an incorrect crypto asset wallet address.</p>

                                <p>Before buying or selling crypto assets, you need to educate yourself about crypto investing as it entails risk and volatility and could result in the loss of your funds. You should ensure that you fully understand the risks involved and that you do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p>

                                <p>Crypto assets are not backed by an entity. Neither PerfectFX Option Trade  nor anyone else has an obligation to buy back the crypto assets in the future.</p>

                                <p>Crypto assets are not legal tender in most countries and are not issued, backed or guaranteed by any government.</p>

                                <p>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at domestic or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, trading and value of crypto assets.</p></p>

                                <p>Because transactions on PerfectFX Option Trade  are generally irreversible, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</p>

                                <p>Crypto asset transactions shall be deemed final when recorded on a blockchain ledger, which is not necessarily the same date or time that the transaction was initiated.</p>

                                <p>There is no assurance that a person who accepts crypto assets as payment today will continue to do so in the future.</p>

                                <p>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of crypto relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss or tax liability over a short period of time.</p>

                                <p>Crypto assets are derived from the continued willingness of market participants to trading fiat currency for crypto, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value.</p>

                                <p>The nature of crypto assets invites an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack.</p>

                                <p>You acknowledge that crypto asset investing involves risk and could result in financial losses.
